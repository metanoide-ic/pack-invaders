# Animation library / schemas (palette for reels)

A broad catalog of animated elements for the upper half of reels. The first sections are
OBSERVED in the reference reels (DZpZb6, DZmqlETDkLl, DYUgxMACNN0, DYUgxMACNN0, DZkFtPxigOy,
DYu6wymj8Vu, DYBv913x2IV, DYZs9FiDIii); the last section is extra ideas to use so you don't repeat yourself.
Everything renders with HyperFrames (HTML/CSS/SVG/GSAP). Golden rules: snappy entrances (0.15-0.25s),
graphics that DRAW themselves/grow, no pulsing of the boxes, contiguous and synchronized to the words.

## Already implemented in scripts/gen.py (GREEN / Ambra example)
intro-aerial (motionPath) · stat+count-up · summary (keyword) · line-graph (dashoffset, up/down) ·
CRM rows · listcheck · calendar · comstep (step-by-step) · iphone reveal · wachat (WhatsApp dark) ·
msgtpl (template with placeholder) · vflow (vertical flow) · cta (meter).

## Implemented in the ORANGE example (`references/examples/gen-reel2-claude.py`) — reusable
- **pricestrike**: brand logo + big price, then a red strike that "wipes it out" (staged entrances: logo → price → strike). For the "stop paying for X" hook.
- **versus**: "A vs B" header with the two logos + metric rows as BARS (track + fill scaleX, value on the right). One metric "tied", one that makes yours win (e.g. POWER tied, COST 1× vs 5× red). The strongest comparison schema.
- **glmreveal / brandreveal**: big logo entering (scale+rotate back.out) + wordmark + "OPEN SOURCE" badge. For the "I'm talking about X".
- **terminal (run | prompt)**: macOS window (3 dots + title) with rows in stagger and a blinking cursor. `run` = "$ claude / ● model … / ✔ connected"; `prompt` = a typed command with tokens in accent color (path, functions, url).
- **testbench (chips)**: versus header + a grid of icon+label chips, one highlights on the word. For "different use cases".
- **abquiz / abreveal**: two browser frames side by side (A|B) with **REAL screenshots** (object-fit:cover, top), a central "?"; then a reveal of the winner (scale + accent glow + "✓" ribbon), loser faded. For "who generated what?".
- **costtag**: giant multiplier with count-up (1→5) + "LESS". For "costs N times less".
- **stepflow**: numbered vertical steps (number circle + title + sub) with arrows, one per trigger word. For a setup "1 API key → 2 paste → 3 use".
- **ctacomment**: large accent pill with the word to comment in quotes (NO emoji) + "and I'll send you the prompt". For the "comment X" CTA.

## Observed in the reels — TO ADD when needed

### Data / numbers
- **Bar chart / columns**: vertical bars that grow (scaleY 0→1, stagger, transform-origin:bottom). For comparisons/quantities (DYUgxMACNN0).
- **Gauge / needle speedometer**: SVG arc + a needle that sweeps (rotate) up to the value, number in the center. For "cost/speed/level" (DZkFtPxigOy "$200", DYUgxMACNN0 "30%").
- **Donut / progress ring**: SVG circle with stroke-dasharray that fills + % in the center.
- **Heatmap / contribution grid**: a grid of cells that light up in sequence (opacity/scale stagger). For "activity/coverage" (DYUgxMACNN0, DZkFtPxigOy).
- **Horizontal progress bar**: already in cta (meter), reusable as a standalone element.
- **Star rating**: 5 stars that fill one by one (DZmqlETDkLl).
- **Table**: rows×columns, rows in stagger; highlight a column/cell (DYUgxMACNN0, the "winging→handed off" is a comparison table).

### Tech / product
- **Terminal / code window**: macOS window (3 dots) with animated typing (width step or opacity per row). (all the tech reels)
- **Code diff**: a git diff with +green / −red highlighted rows, the rows enter in stagger, + a token counter (DYUgxMACNN0 "+12.267 tok").
- **Chip/tile with icons**: a row/grid of small cards with icon+label, one highlights on the word (DZkFtPxigOy, the "DIVISIONS" reel).
- **Waveform / EQ**: audio bars that bounce (decorative use, or for "voice/audio"); do NOT use it as an omnipresent generic pseudo-sync, but as an element of an audio scene (DZmqlETDkLl).

### Layout / reveal
- **2-panel comparison** (✗ red strikethrough vs ✓ green): already done as comstep+compare; the full two-column version with an arrow is strong.
- **Device reveal**: a real screenshot inside a mockup (iphone) that enters (slide/scale). For the "real product".
- **Chat mockup**: WhatsApp/iMessage dark, in/out bubbles in stagger, header with logo.
- **Flow / pipeline**: boxes+arrows, vertical (top→bottom, Riccardo's preference) or horizontal.

## Extra ideas (not in the reels — to vary, as requested)
- **Odometer / number flip**: digits that roll (slot machine) instead of a smooth count-up.
- **Map + pin/route**: for trips/places (useful for Ambra: a map with destination pins that light up).
- **Marker / highlighter sweep**: a highlighter that passes over a keyword.
- **Carousel / card stack**: cards that scroll/stack (e.g. travel offers).
- **Pie chart** that draws itself slice by slice.
- **Timeline / milestones**: a line with stages that light up.
- **Toast / notifications** that enter stacking up (e.g. "new reactivated lead").
- **Leaderboard / racing bars** (bar race).
- **Counter "+N" rising** (e.g. "+12 reactivated clients" incrementing).
- **Kinetic typography**: a keyword that explodes/assembles (beyond the karaoke).
- **Comparison slider** (before/after with a sliding line).

## How to add one to gen.py
1. Add a new `type` in `inner(i,t,p)` (HTML+CSS of the element, final state).
2. Add the tweens in `tw` for that type (entrance + draw/grow, anchored to `s` or to a word trigger).
3. Put it in the `BEATS` with the right trigger. Keep it CONTIGUOUS and SYNCHRONIZED.
4. Render → extract a frame → compare against the reel → iterate.

## New techniques (from the reel1 project — green, 4 Claude skills)
Ready-made snippets, anchor the animations to the real word timings (find/find_after).

- **Staged hook with a big LOGO**: stage1 text ("4 SKILL") that pops on a word, then exits
  (`opacity:0,scale:0.85`) when the next keyword starts; stage2 = `<img>` big logo
  (height ~360px) that enters (`scale:0.4,rotate:-30 -> 1,0`); stage3 = red "ILLEGAL" stamp below
  the logo on another word. Anchor each stage to a DIFFERENT word with find().
- **Per-word pill with emoji**: as the user lists things (output/text/email), one pill per word
  appears on the `find()` of that word (`opacity:0,y:18,scale:0.85 -> 1`), with a themed emoji (📄 ✍🏻 📧).
  Then the pills dim (`opacity:0.3`) and a green result appears centered on another word.
- **TYPEWRITER terminal** (real typing, NOT TextPlugin): a terminal window (bar with 3 dots + title,
  monospace body). Typing = tween on a counter + `textContent=val.slice(0,Math.round(n))`, `ease:"none"`,
  duration ∝ length. Use `textContent` (not innerHTML/TextPlugin) so the `<role></role>` tags show up
  LITERAL. Cursor `▋` blinks via CSS. A confused state (gray) → empties → a perfect state (green, XML).
- **Count-up vs POP**: count-up (`tl.to({v:0},{v:N,onUpdate...})`) ONLY if the beat lasts >1.2s; below that, POP the
  final number (`opacity:0,scale:1.45 -> 1`, back.out) so it's legible. For "91.000+" format with `toLocaleString` + "+".
- **"Card" blocks 1-2-3-4**: N green rounded-rects entering staggered; ANCHOR them with
  `find_after("queste quattro", beat_start)` if the anchor word recurs earlier (in the hook) — otherwise they start too soon.
- **User B-roll in the upper band**: see the "B-roll" section in SKILL.md. Full-bleed `scale=-2:864,crop=1080:864`
  for landscape screen captures, `scale=-2:824` centered for portrait documents; a black band below + enable=between(t,A,B).
